# AlgorithmSorts
Sorting a large number of elements in an array using different algorithms


This is a class that I took with Professor Shana Watters at Augsburg College and scored a 3.5

It's the basic, popular sorting algorithms built with Java code.
This particular folder contains a unnamed package with all of the sorts and a couple txt files with randomly generated numbers, to 
demostrate the run-times with each sort. We compare these to what our predictions were based on Big(O) notation calculations.
